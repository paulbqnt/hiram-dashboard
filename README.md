# hiram-dashboard

Hiram is a free financial library built in python that can be used for option pricing and financial products management. Hiram is specifically useful students and junior practitioners.

This streamlit dashboard goal is to show the feature of my python library **Hiram**

## Let's consider you are an option market maker on the S&P 500

### This dashboard will help you to:
1. Check the recent underlying stock behavior (price, historical vol, volume traded)
2. Price options with both Black Scholes Merton and Monte-Carlo
3. Check the Greeks of the option
4. Generate marketing documents in PDF (working on it..)
